## Abstract

The onset of long-form egocentric datasets such as Ego4D and EPIC-Kitchens presents
a new challenge for the task of Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG). Compared to traditional 
benchmarks on which this task is evaluated, these datasets offer finer-grained
sentences to ground in notably longer videos. In this paper, we develop an approach 
for learning to ground sentences in these datasets using only narrations and their corresponding 
rough narration timestamps. We propose to artificially merge clips to train
for temporal grounding in a contrastive manner using text-conditioning attention. This
Clip Merging (CliMer) approach is shown to be effective when compared with a high
performing TSG methodâ€”e.g. mean R@1 improves from 3.9 to 5.7 on Ego4D and
from 10.7 to 13.0 on EPIC-Kitchens. Code and data splits available from: [https://github.com/keflanagan/CliMer](https://github.com/keflanagan/CliMer)
